    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Image caption Generator is a popular research area of Artificial Intelligence that deals with image understanding and a language description for that image. Generating well-formed sentences requires both syntactic and semantic understanding of the language. Being able to describe the content of an image using accurately formed sentences is a very challenging task, but it could also have a great impact, by helping visually impaired people better understand the content of images. 
 This task is significantly harder in comparison to the image classification or object recognition tasks that have been well researched. </p>
