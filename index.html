    <p style="color:rgb(74, 49, 92)">Image description task has been invariably examined in a static manner with qualitative presumptions held to be universally applicable, regardless of the scope or target of the description. In practice, however, different viewers may pay attention to different aspects of the image, and yield different descriptions or interpretations under various contexts. Such diversity in perspectives is difficult to derive with conventional image description techniques. In this paper, we propose a customized image narrative generation task, in which the users are interactively engaged in the generation process by providing answers to the questions. We further attempt to learn the user's interest via repeating such interactive stages, and to automatically reflect the interest in descriptions for new images. Experimental results demonstrate that our model can generate a variety of descriptions from single image that cover a wider range of topics than conventional models, while being customizable to the target user of interaction.

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Image caption Generator is a popular research area of Artificial Intelligence that deals with image understanding and a language description for that image.
    Image Captioning is the process of generating a textual description for given images. It has been a very important and fundamental task in the Deep Learning domain. Image captioning has a huge amount of application. NVIDIA is using image captioning technologies to create an application to help people who have low or no eyesight.
